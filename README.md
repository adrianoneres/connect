# Connect

Connect is a small terminal utility, built in python, that helps you to organize your connections to external hosts. It just keeps a local register of your hosts - without passwords - to increase the agility in opening new connections.

## How to

1. Clone the project and navigate to __Connect__ directory:

```sh
    cd connect
```
2. Make sure you have execute permission on the `connect` script file:

```sh
    chmod +x connect
```

3. Run `connect` script:

```sh
    ./connect
```
